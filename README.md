# Maze-Generator
2D maze generator and solver

🧩 - This is to create a simple 2D maze game🎮 which can be played as game and also be a solver(BFS alogorithm) to solve the maze puzzle

Three modes:
1) Maze generate - (using bactracking algorithm actual maze structure is created, Do google to know more about bactracking algo) 🎲
2) Play mode - (here intutive kind of player movement is implemented, you can actualy paly the game if stuck somwhere just press CRTL to solve) 🎮
3) Solution - (The famouse BFS path finding algorithm is used to solve - implementation can be visualised)🤔

Suggestions are welcome🔥🔥🔥
